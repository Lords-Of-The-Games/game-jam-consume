# 🌑 Game Jam: **Consume**

> *They say essence is everything.*

It binds the sky to the soil, breathes life into flesh, and weaves thought into being.  
In the **MexoSerb** part of the world, even the wind carries it — unseen, yet vital.

Without essence, we fade.  
We forget.  
We are unmade.

## ⚠️ Something Stirs...

But something has begun to stir in the far reaches of the land —  
a **hollow place** where light bends strangely and sound refuses to echo.

From deep within it, something **consumes**.  
*Slowly. Hungrily.*  
It drinks the world dry.

- Villages wither  
- Voices vanish  
- Even memories rot at the edge of that creeping dark

No one who ventured near has returned.  
**Not intact.**

## 🧭 One Girl’s Resolve

While others fled or turned a blind eye,  
**one girl** chose to follow the pull.

Drawn by instinct — or perhaps something buried deep within her own **essence** —  
she stepped beyond the known.

Into the **dying land**.  
Into the **teeth** of the thing that devours.

Her **name** has already begun to slip.  
But her **resolve** burns bright.

## 🔥 She Will Face It

She will find what dwells there.  
And if need be...

> **She will _consume_ it.**
