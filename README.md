They say essence is everything.
It binds the sky to the soil, breathes life into flesh, and weaves thought into being. In MexoSerb part of the world, even the wind carries it — unseen, yet vital. Without essence, we fade. We forget. We are unmade.
But something has begun to stir in the far reaches of the land — a hollow place where light bends strangely and sound refuses to echo. From deep within it, something consumes. Slowly, hungrily, it drinks the world dry. Villages wither, voices vanish, and even memories rot at the edge of that creeping dark.
No one who ventured near has returned. Not intact.
And so, while others fled or closed their eyes, one girl chose to follow the pull.
Drawn by instinct, or perhaps something buried deep within her own essence, she stepped beyond the known — into the dying land, into the teeth of the thing that devours.
Her name has already begun to slip. But her resolve burns bright.
She will find what dwells there. And if need be… she will consume it.
