protagonist: So are you like a memory or my past life or something?
other_you: I don't think so. Memories can't fart.
protagonist: Ah, yes. The  unifying constant of humanity. You fart. Therefore, you are.
other_you: Although I can't really do much else.
protagonist: So what? We're just supposed to wait here and silently be consumed by the cave?
other_you (tired): I already fought and lost. I can't do more. I want to go home.
- I'm still full of energy. We'll get through this together.
	protagonist: I'm still full of energy. We'll get through this together.
- I'll help you get home, little buddy.
	protagonist: I'll help you get home, little buddy.
You feel something stirring  in the cave. 
It sounds big and angry.
You should stop talking to the other you.
