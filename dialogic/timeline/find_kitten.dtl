Deep in the bowels of the Cave you find a kitten. Your mind races with explanations of how it can survive within, or how it got here in the first place.
In the end, it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is your choice.
- Leave the kitten.
- Rescue the kitten.
	You don't hesitate. The kitten needs help, and you respond in kind.
	A chill runs down your spine. The cave doesn't want you to rescue this kitten. 
	Another reason to do it.
