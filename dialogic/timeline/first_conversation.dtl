protagonist: Why do you look so much like me?
other_you: I dunno. The governor told me that I was supposed to be this year's sacrifice for the cave...
other_you: Obviously that didn't work. I'm still here.
other_you: I just ran out of energy and now I can't get out nor progress further into the cave.
protagonist: This cave is weird. Every time I do something, I feel like it takes away a bit of myself.
other_you: Maybe that's what happened? Maybe it took too much, and I am what remains. Be careful. It might happen to you.
protagonist: I guess it already did...
