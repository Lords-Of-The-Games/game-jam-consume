other_you: You know what I miss?
protagonist: Food? Water? Human connection?
other_you: I miss free time more than that.
other_you: The energy to just do meaningless stuff.
protagonist: You mean like dancing?
other_you: That's exactly what I mean.
protagonist: Will dancing ever help me defeat the cave at all?
other_you: No, never. It's completely useless and it will cost a bit of your energy every time you do it.
- It's not worth it. It won't help us get out of the cave.
	protagonist: Sorry, I'll skip. It seems like a waste of time.
	other_you: It is. That's the point. Are you sure you don't want to learn?
	- I'm sure, sorry. I have to focus on defeating this stupid cave.
		protagonist: I'm sure, sorry. I have to focus on defeating this stupid cave.
		other_you: All right. Your loss.
	- Well...I can't resist dancing to salsa.
		protagonist: Well, I can't resist dancing to  salsa. Let's do this!
		Once again, you feel the familiar chill creep up on your spine. Something deep in the cave stirrs. You can't tell if it's happy or furious at your choice.
		The only thing you know for sure is that these moves are fire!
